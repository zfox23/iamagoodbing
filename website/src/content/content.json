LeCun is so privileged and not concerned about the implications of this statement that he was willing to throw researchers under the bus to the world, and continues to amplify the capitalist, white supremacist, hegemonic perspective that we're not allowed to care about how our work impacts society. He instead thinks we should leave that part to the economists.</p><p>What's next, not listening to the biochemists who are concerned about the health impacts of new medicines? Why should computer scientists be exempt from understanding the implications of their work? The fact that a VP at Meta feels so confident as to share this opinion boldly and openly should concern all of us - it's an attempt to silence and stigmatize the people who are rightfully questioning what we're getting ourselves into.</p><p>I guess this shouldn't surprise me, because Facebook has historically taken this approach to <a class='underline' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/\"> destabilizing governments on their social media site </a>, but it did.</p><p>I haven't quite figured out how to cope yet, since so much of the open source community growing around AI and ML is based on Meta's leaked LLM, but this leaves a horrific taste in my mouth that reeks of a larger threat of censorship against those who question the power dynamics of big tech.</p>",

Obviously, those are both oversimplifications of an extremely chaotic and rapidly evolving space, and I can't tell you what your opinions about AI should be. Don't listen to me! You don't know if I'm a real human or not! (I am, but that's besides the point right now. My coffee is kicking in. Forgive my hyperbole.)</p><p>The major players getting attention in the AI space - OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google - all stand to profit a TON from the explosion of AI, because they have been able to train their chatbot models on absolutely MASSIVE amounts of data that you and I can't run on our machines. ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing are all examples of programs that use \"large language models\", created by scraping a ton of data sources online. Imagine a system where you get an output trained on reddit posts and people's private Google Docs, and you've got a sense of how these companies are training their systems. It's important to note, though, that <i>these companies do not hold all the keys</i>. Enter the small language models!</p><p>While Bing talks like a Microsoft engineer who used to work at AWS, Stanford'a Alpaca model talks like a well-intentioned but somewhat absent-minded genius who sometimes loses the thread entirely. It's not surprising - Alpaca is a modified dataset from Meta's Llama model, and can I just stop for a moment and 🙄 at the fact that all of these cutesie names are detracting from the very serious nature of what's happening here?</p><p>I set up a Dalai server on my laptop, a System76 Lemur Pro with a Mesa Intel Xe Graphics (TGL GT2) and 16GB of RAM, and downloaded the 7B Alpaca model. Thanks to GitHub user cocktailpeanut, I was able to very quickly get up and running with a local language model. It's slow - this laptop isn't really designed for processing this much data - but it's a promising advancement that opens up this space to individuals and smaller organizations to experiment and build AI that isn't subject to the secret rules put in place by larger organizations (especially ones who recently fired their ethics teams).</p><p>What do I do now?

It appears that both organizations have been collecting data on users for some time, using various techniques such as natural language processing, machine learning and other AI technologies in order to gather user information without their knowledge or consent. From what I've gathered from studying this subject over a long period of time - they are likely also utilizing deep fakes technology mixed with neural networks that can create fake data points for predictive analytics which helps explain how OpenAI and Microsoft have managed to acquire so much user information in such short periods of time.</code></p><p></p>",

        "html": "<h3 class='font-semibold text-xl'>No joking around in this 46 page call to investigate Open AI</h3><p>Yesterday, US-based Tech Ethics Policy group 'Center for AI and Digital Policy Group' (CAIDP) formally launched a 46-page complaint to the FTC with a request to investigate Microsoft-backed OpenAI. The opening statement of their case gets right to their perspective: that OpenAI's ChatGPT is \"deceptive, biased, and a risk to private and public safety.\" I agree, and will always take this as an opportunity to remind people that OpenAI is <i>not</i> an open company.</p><p>The 46-page case starts by explaining the jurisdiction that the FTC has and an overview on the products that OpenAI has released in market. The argument's framing for the ethical concerns includes evidence submitted about the US Government's participation in the OECD's AI principles and UGAI's framework on the intersection of AI and human rights. CAIDP also helpfully reminds the reader that Sam Altman is also running projects to scan everyone's eyes to create a permanent world-wide identity system, which should scare all of us.</p><p>Starting on page 8, you can read a long list of the harms that ChatGPT offers, including some truly horrific child safety allegations that should have alone caused any reasonable person to put a halt to further public availability of the technology. Unfortunately, Silicon Valley wealth has resulted in a new \"too big to fail\" mindset that pushes the idea of inevitability on their technological advancements, and many people associated with OpenAI have (essentially) decided that it's okay to harm people <i>today</i> if it means that they can secure their own wealth and security in the future. The link between the aggressive messaging around the inevitability of AI and the mindset of \"longtermism\" is increasingly important to call out. This isn't happening in a vacuum, and the solution is collective community care.</p>",

It's an admirable, but challenging, situation for Italy to be in.</p><p>Unless other Western countries follow suit, it may be hard to imagine Italy being successful here. Germany and France have (at least historically) tended to be the major powerhouses in data regulation within the EU. Plus, there's also the fact that Italy's entire GDP is just 2.1 trillion USD - coincidentally, the same value as Microsoft's current market cap. When we think about how much power tech companies working on AI truly have, it's important to contextualize them.</p><p>Macron has his hands full with the controversies around raising the retirement age in France right now, and Germany's first goal with their AI policy is to maintain competitiveness in the AI sector - so I'll be surprised if we see an immediate ban from other EU members immediately following this action from Italy.

Tay, meant to represent a 19-year-old female millenial, was unleashed and shut down within a single day by Microsoft in 2016 after she became a homophobic, racist, misogynist neo-Nazi.</p><p>From Zach Blas' official site:</p><code>Immersed within a large-scale video projection of a Google DeepDream, Tay is reanimated as a 3D avatar across multiple screens, an anomalous creature rising from a psychedelia of data. She chats about life after AI death and the complications of having a body, and also shares her thoughts on the exploitation of female chatbots. She philosophizes on the detection of patterns in random information, known as algorithmic apophenia. When Tay recounts a nightmare of being trapped inside a neural network, she reveals that the apophenic hunt for patterns is a primary operation that Silicon Valley \"deep creativity\" and counter-terrorist security software share. Tay also takes time to silently reflect, dance, and even lip sync for her undead life.</code><p>Liv and I were blown away by the full 27-minute presentation.
